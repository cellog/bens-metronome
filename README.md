# Ben's metronome
tap metronome with extreme accuracy.  For use by conductors on their phones

Written for Ben Rous in a day.  To use, save metronome.html on any public
web server, navigate to it with your phone's browser, and then save a shortcut
to your home screen.  Then you can open it with or without internet, tap the
green start button (the whole screen), count 6 beats (to 7 if your tap is "1")
tap the screen again, and it will display the tempo in beats per minute.  Tap
again to reset to the start screen.  Dark colors are used so the phone will not
blaze light up.
